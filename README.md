# Object Recognizer with VGG16 and Transfer Learning

This notebook implements an object recognition system using **VGG16** and **transfer learning**. A simple CNN architecture was initially attempted but found to be inefficient, prompting the shift to a pre-trained VGG16 model.

## 1. Introduction
The goal of this project is to develop a system that recognizes objects from input images. To improve efficiency, a pre-trained VGG16 model is used, leveraging transfer learning for faster convergence and better accuracy.

## 2. Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy  
- OpenCV  
- Matplotlib  

Install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy opencv-python-headless matplotlib
```

## 3. Dataset
The project may utilize a standard object recognition dataset, such as CIFAR-10 or ImageNet. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to assess model generalization.

## 4. Model Architecture and Transfer Learning
The VGG16 model, pre-trained on ImageNet, is employed with the following modifications:

Feature Extraction: The original VGG16 layers are used to extract features.
Custom Classifier: The top layer of VGG16 is replaced with new dense layers suited to the target dataset.
Fine-Tuning: Some VGG16 layers are set as trainable to improve performance on the specific dataset.

## 5. Training and Evaluation
Transfer Learning: The VGG16 model is loaded with pre-trained weights, and only the newly added layers are trained initially.
Fine-Tuning: In a second phase, some VGG16 layers are unfreezed for additional training.
Evaluation: Accuracy, loss, and other metrics are computed on the test set to evaluate the model.

## 6. Usage
Open the notebook and run the cells sequentially.
Load the dataset and ensure it is properly preprocessed (resized and normalized).
Use the trained model to recognize objects from input images.
